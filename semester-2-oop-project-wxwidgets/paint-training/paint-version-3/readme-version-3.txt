Previously:
Shapes : Implemented Square through vectors
Files included : Classes.h(all classes of shapes etc)
No menubar
In BasicDrawPane class's a vector of shapes pointer was declared in private.
In BasicDrawPane class's constructor square pointer was pushed into the vector.
In render iteration was used on the vector and then square was drawn after if-check using DrawLine function.

Update 26/4:
All the shapes are done now which include Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle and Line. All the shapes are forming. The code is fine up til now.
Made separate vectors and variables for different shapes.
Files included: classes.h(classes.cpp through linker),formulas.h(formulas.cpp through linker)
